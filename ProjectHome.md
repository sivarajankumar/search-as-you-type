**Search-as-you-Type**

The new Search-as-you-Type (SayT) application allows you to add dynamic, real-time search to your Google Mini, Google Search Appliance, or Custom Search Business Edition.  Your search box will dynamically present suggestions and auto-complete queries before the user is even done typing!  In fact, we've architected it in such a way that you can use Search-as-you-Type on any text input field!

We've also designed the project so you can get it up and running with sample data out of the box.  Then you can later integrate it with your existing systems by hooking into a simple server side interface.

Watch a [video demonstration](http://www.google.com/enterprise/labs/sayt_video.html) or check out the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/search-as-you-type/downloads/list) tab to see how to setup and deploy **Search-as-you-Type** in your organization.

Please join the [Google Enterprise Labs Discussion Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/google-enterprise-labs) after you download the software so we can keep you up-to-date on new versions and bug fixes as they are released.  You can also use the forum to ask questions, hear about new experiments that are coming, and suggest ideas for new experiments!

The example below shows how you might wish to provide quick access to employee contact information, conference rooms, office addresses, glossary definitions, query suggestions, etc.
